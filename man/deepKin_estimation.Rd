\usage{
deepKin_estimation(grm.diag, grm.tri, xcohort = F, me, pop_size1, pop_size2)
}
\arguments{
\item{grm.diag}{an n vector}

\item{grm.tri}{when xcohort = F, grm.tri is an n\*(n-1) vector; when xcohort = T, it is an n1\*n2 vector}

\item{xcohort}{xcohort = T for cross-cohort GRM extraction; xcohort = F for one cohort GRM;
Make sure that when you use xcohort = T, the individual order is organized just the same order cohort by cohort.}

\item{me}{the effective number of markers}

\item{pop_size1}{population size for the first cohort when xcohort = T}

\item{pop_size2}{population size for the second cohort when xcohort = T}
}

deepKin estimates and p-values
